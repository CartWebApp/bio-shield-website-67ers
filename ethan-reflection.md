# BioShield Reflection
**This document reflects on the process in making our BioShield website and how the use of AI influenced the creation.**
## Design Process
We had a step by step process in which we wanted to execute our creation of the website.
- Assess what other competitive websites looked like and how effective they were in luring in customers. (We used **Bugsoother.com** and **off.com** for our competitive websites)
- Ask **Google Gemini** to create realistic images of BioShield's products, including a spray, wipes, and balm.
- Wanted our website to have an **nature/outdoor** aesthetic to fit BioShield's philosophy of using **natural** ingredients and **plant-based** essential oils
- We wanted our website to look visually appealing and not obnoxious, as well as easy to navigate.

## Programming Process
- Ask **ChatGPT** to make a base website that we were able to tweak and refine in order to further fit project requirements.
- Ask **Github Copilot** to generate and modify codes that fit our desired content.

## Overview of Developer Influence
- Acknowledges the influence the *Developers* (me and my partner) had on the website.
- Created the idea on how the website should be made.
- Inputted prompts to AI that refines the website's code and visuals.
- Had the basic insight of the website that influences the end product AI should aim for.

## Overview of AI Influence 
- Acknowledges the influence *AI* had on the creation of the content and code for the website.
- **Google Gemini** used for Pictures and Visuals
- **ChatGPT** and **Github Copilot** used for code.
- We also used **Adobe Firefly** for visuals but did not produce any ***usable*** products (all were **scrapped**).
